Each role brings unique expertise to the project, ensuring a balance of technical excellence, user satisfaction, and efficient delivery. Collaboration between these roles is key to building successful software products.


# üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The project leverages the following technologies to build a scalable and efficient backend for the Airbnb Clone:

## **Backend Framework**  
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the RESTful API. It provides built-in security, ORM, and scalability.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Extends Django to simplify RESTful API development, offering tools for serialization, authentication, and CRUD operations.  

## **Database**  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database for structured data storage, ensuring ACID compliance and performance for user, property, and booking data.  

## **API Querying**  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient data querying, allowing clients to request only the needed data (e.g., nested property-booking details in a single query).  

## **Asynchronous Tasks**  
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks (e.g., payment processing, email notifications) asynchronously to improve responsiveness.  
- **Redis**: Serves as both a message broker for Celery and a caching layer to reduce database load (e.g., caching frequent property listings).  

## **DevOps & Deployment**  
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) to ensure code quality and rapid releases.  

## **Optimizations**  
- **Database Indexing**: Accelerates query performance for frequently accessed data (e.g., user searches for properties).  
- **Caching (Redis)**: Stores temporary data (e.g., session tokens, API responses) to reduce latency.
